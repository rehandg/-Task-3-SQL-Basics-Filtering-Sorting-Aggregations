# Task 3 – SQL Basics: Filtering, Sorting, and Aggregations

## Objective
The goal of this task was to gain hands-on experience with basic SQL operations by working on a real-world dataset and performing common data analysis queries.

---

## Dataset Used
- Chinook Database (MySQL version)

The Chinook database simulates a digital music store and contains tables such as customers, invoices, tracks, albums, and artists.

---

## Tools Used
- MySQL Server
- MySQL Command Line Client

---

## Steps Performed

1. Installed and verified MySQL Server.
2. Created a new database named `chinook`.
3. Imported the Chinook MySQL dataset using the command-line interface.
4. Verified successful import by listing available tables.
5. Explored the dataset using basic `SELECT` queries.
6. Applied filtering using the `WHERE` clause.
7. Sorted data using `ORDER BY`.
8. Used aggregate functions such as `SUM`, `AVG`, and `COUNT`.
9. Grouped data using `GROUP BY` and filtered grouped results using `HAVING`.
10. Queried data within a date range using `BETWEEN`.
11. Performed pattern matching using the `LIKE` operator.
12. Saved all SQL queries in a `queries_task3.sql` file.
13. Exported aggregated sales results to `sales_summary.csv`.

## Key Outcome
Successfully loaded a real-world dataset into MySQL and executed essential SQL queries to filter, sort, and summarize data, building a strong foundation in practical SQL querying.
